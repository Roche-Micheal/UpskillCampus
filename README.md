# Prediction of Agriculture Crop Production in India

### Data Preprocessing
1. Load the dataset using pandas.
2. Handle missing values, if any, in the dataset.
3. Convert the "Season" column to the appropriate format (number of days).
4. Convert categorical variables (e.g., "Variety," "State," "Recommended Zone") into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding.

### Feature Selection and Engineering
1. Decide which features are relevant for predicting crop production. Some potentially relevant features might be "Variety," "State," "Season," "Recommended Zone," and "Cost."
2. Engineer new features if possible, such as extracting the year from the "Production" column.

### Data Splitting
1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets. A common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing.
